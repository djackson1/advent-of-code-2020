# advent of code 2020

here we are again, advent of code adventures but 2020
## creating a folder for the day

from the root folder run

```bash
./utils/create-day.sh <NUMBER>
```

this will create the following folders and files:

```
/src/day<NUMBER>
/src/day<NUMBER>/input.txt
/src/day<NUMBER>/main.js
```

and it will have a variable called `inputs` which will read in the `input.txt`

## running a day

this will output both part a and b

```bash
node src/day<NUMBER>/main.js
```

## thoughts

yeah we also got to day 14 this year before it became too much to handle!
